# Hoffman Lab Website

This repository hosts the source for the Hoffman Lab at Harvard. The website is built in Jekyll, a static site generator.

## Setup

To get started, follow Ruby installation instructions ![here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

From there, clone this repo, `cd` in and run `gem install jekyll bundler`.

Then start serving the website with `bundle exec jekyll serve`. If all goes well, you should see a live-reloading copy of the site!

Google online for setting up Github pages hosting for Jekyll.
