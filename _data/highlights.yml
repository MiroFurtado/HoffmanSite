- title: "Fermi Surface & Pseudogap in a Cuprate"
  description: "Superconductivity arises from pairing of electrons on the Fermi surface. Here we use Fourier transform STM to map a small-to-large Fermi surface transition in the cuprate superconductor Bi2-yPbySr2-xLaxCuO6+d, demonstrating a quantum critical point near optimal doping at zero field. Furthermore, we show that superconductivity coexists with the pseudogap on the recovered antinodal Fermi surface above optimal doping. Finally, we demonstrate the nanoscale decoherence effect of the pseudogap, despite the robust magnitude of the superconducting order parameter. Our work suggests the importance of mitigating this decoherence at the nanoscale, to optimize superconductivity."

- title: "CDW on the Surface & Bulk of $$Bi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_{6+d}$$"
  description: "We combined resonant x-ray scattering (REXS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to observe a charge order that appears consistently in surface and bulk, and in momentum and real space within one cuprate family, Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+d. Combined with earlier observations of electronic order in other cuprate families, these findings suggest the existence of a generic charge-ordered state in underdoped cuprates and uncover its intimate connection to the pseudogap regime."

- title: "Kondo Insulating Gap on $$SmB_6$$"
  description: "We use STM to conduct the first atomic resolution spectroscopic study of the cleaved surface of SmB6, and to reveal a robust hybridization gap that universally spans the Fermi level. Employing a cotunneling model, we separate the density of states of the hybridized bands from which the predicted topological surface states must be disentangled. Our technique lays the groundwork for understanding the first strongly correlated topological insulator, and implements a general method to quantitatively understand a wider class of Kondo insulators."
