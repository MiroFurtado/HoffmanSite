# Prof. Hoffman's Recommendation Policy

### (1) Allow at least 2 weeks notice for the first request.

(This can sometimes be waived if there are extenuating circumstances, but I cannot guarantee that my schedule will allow short turnaround at any given time.)

### (2) Put the recommendation deadline in the subject line of all emails.

For example: "Feb 1 deadline, recommendation request"
If there are multiple deadlines, put the first one in the subject line.

### (3) At least 1 week before deadline, include in a single email:

* CV
* draft of personal statement, or at least an informal paragraph or two about why you are applying to this program and how it fits into your short and long term goals
* unofficial transcript (for undergraduates)
* student teaching evaluations (if you have worked as a TF or course assistant)
* information about the programs you are applying to:
    * list of URLs for the programs (if applicable)
    * list of deadlines for the letters
    * information about how to submit the letters (electronic submission preferred)
    * PDFs of any forms that need to be filled out (fill out all fields you can)
    * information about the competitiveness of the program may also be helpful (e.g. 1 winner out of 1000 applicants, or 50% acceptance rate, etc.)
* Please ensure that all attached files have useful names, e.g. YourName-CV.pdf and YourName-transcript.pdf.

### (4) At least 1 week before deadline: write and format the letter yourself.

This may at first sound uncomfortable to you, but it is standard practice for faculty who are called upon to write dozens of letters per year. Doing this, in fact, allows me to send a more thorough letter of recommendation for you because you know the specific accomplishments you wish to highlight better than I do, so you will be able to write a more detailed letter for yourself than I would alone. Rest assured that I will read and vet every sentence of your draft very carefully, and I will correct and augment as I see fit before I sign and send it.

#### (4a) Content: use examples to support each adjective

Think about your key characteristics that you would like to make known. This is basically a list of adjectives. Now think of one concrete example that supports each characteristic. For example, if you want to claim that you are creative, then you need a concrete example of your creativity - a new idea or solution that you are proud of! If you want to claim that you are persistent, then you need a concrete example of the multiple different attempts that you made to solve a particular problem. If your letter includes adjectives without concrete examples, I will have to delete them.

#### (4b) Formatting:

Here is <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/YYYY-MM-DD-Hoffman-recommendation-for-Student-Program.docx">formatted template</a>

Please name your file:
YYYY-MM-DD-Hoffman-recommendation-for-YourName-ProgramName.docx
(Note: if you are applying to multiple programs, just write one letter and name it according to the program with earliest deadline.) 

#### (4c) Attention to detail:

Your care in sending organized emails with useful subject lines and comprehensive information, as well as your ability to write a carefully-formatted, correctly-spelled, articulate letter on your own behalf, form a part of my impression of your ability to communicate. Clear communication is essential for success in science. I am reluctant or unable to recommend people who do not demonstrate that they are clear thinkers and communicators.

### (5) Solicit input from TF or research mentor.

If you are a student in my class and you have gotten to know your TF well, or if you are a student in my lab and you are working more directly with a grad student or postdoc research mentor: you may ask the TF or research mentor to directly email me a paragraph or two about their impressions of your work. You should give the TF or research mentor a deadline to email their contribution to me by the time you email me your letter. You may leave a placeholder in your letter, such as "insert paragraph from Name-of-TF here".

### (6) Multiple recommendations.

If you are applying to multiple programs with multiple deadlines, please get all of your information together in advance of the first deadline, so that all recommendations can be submitted in a single sitting. It can be mind-boggling to receive multiple automatic emails requesting recommendations for different programs, spread out over several days or weeks. Please be organized and click the web buttons to generate those automatic emails to the recommender all in one sitting, so that the recommender receives all the recommendation requests within a short time frame. Then you can send me a quick email saying "You should have just received 5 automatically generated recommendation requests from Universities A, B, C, D, and E. Please let me know if you didn't receive any of these."

### (7) You are responsible for sending reminders.

While I will try to let you know when I have submitted the recommendation, you are ultimately responsible for checking to make sure your application is complete. If the deadline is fast approaching, please send polite reminders, ideally in the same email thread so that all relevant attachments & information remain together.


## Good luck with your application!
