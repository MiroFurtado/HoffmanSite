# Harvard Undergraduates

## Information Requested


* Send to Prof. Hoffman (jhoffman@physics.harvard.edu) and cc to Dionne Clarke (dlclarke@fas.harvard.edu) with useful subject line.
* Email about your experience, interests, and goals (1-2 paragraphs. No prior research experience is necessary, but if you have some, we'd be interested to hear about it.)
* CV (include experience, skills, and coursework; see example)
* Unofficial transcript (not essential, if relevant coursework is already on your CV)
* Preferred employment dates (e.g. "spring semester only" or "summer from June 10-Aug 20, then continuing into fall semester & possibly beyond". Note that a summer internship is typically 10+ weeks, and a term-time commitment must be at least 10 hours/week, to maintain substantive progress.)
* Funding you have in hand, or plan to apply for (see below); or desired course credit (e.g. ES 91r, Physics 91r). Note that you can either receive pay or course credit in a given semester, but not both simultaneously.
