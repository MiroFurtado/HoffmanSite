<h1>Visiting Students</h1>

<h3>Information Requested (ideally by March 15 for summer internships)</h3>
<ul>
 <li><h5>Email with the following information</h5>
 <ul>
  <li>Send to Prof. Hoffman (<a href="mailto:jhoffman@physics.harvard.edu?subject=work%20in%20%your%20lab&cc=dlclarke@fas.harvard.edu">jhoffman&#64;physics.harvard.edu</a>) and cc to Dionne Clarke (<a 
href="mailto:dlclarke@fas.harvard.edu">dlclarke&#64;fas.harvard.edu</a>) with useful subject line.</li>
  <li> Experience, interests, &amp; goals (1-2 paragraphs)</li>
  <li> Preferred employment dates (e.g. &quot;June 15 - Aug 30&quot;. Note that a typical summer internsthip is at least 10 weeks.)</li>
  <li> Will you have your own funding? (We do not typically have funding to support external undergraduates. For reference, a typical Harvard undergraduate receives &#36;4000 for 10 weeks of summer 
employment, which gives a sense of the local cost of living.)</li>
  <li> Will you have your own health insurance? (If you're in the US, you're typically on your parents' insurance through age 26. If you're international, you may need to purchase travel health insurance, 
example links coming soon...)
  <li> Full contact information for at least 2 references (full name, context &amp; duration in which they know you, email, phone number)</li>
 </ul>
 <li><h5>Attachments</h5>
 <ul>
  <li>CV (include experience, skills, and most important coursework; see <a href="exampleCV1.pdf">example</a>)</li>
  <li>Transcript</li>
 </ul>
 <li><h5>Reference letter</h5> Please also arrange for at least one letter (from one of your above-named references) to be emailed directly to me, with your name in the subject line. Ideally this letter should come 
from somebody who knows you well in a research setting. (Note that in the US, students do not typically read their own reference letters. If a reference letter comes to me directly from a student, 
it would not be interpreted as a serious, honest letter.)
 </ul>
